# Wallter

Daniel Stanley, Jake McKinnon, Michelle Wan

## What do you want to be able to make?

## What is innovative about this proposal?
There are many homemade wall bots online, but none of them seem to have multiple colors. The kickstarter robot Scribit could do up to 4 markers, but ours should be able to do more with fewer moving parts.

## What do you think will be the hardest part of the project?
Getting the right pressure of the pen on the wall.
