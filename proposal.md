# Wallter

Daniel Stanley, Jake McKinnon, Michelle Wan

## What do you want to be able to make?

## What is innovative about this proposal?
There are many homemade wall bots online, but none of them seem to have multiple colors. The kickstarter robot Scribit could do up to 4 markers, but ours should be able to do more with fewer moving parts.

## What do you think will be the hardest part of the project?
Getting the right pressure of the pen on the wall.

# Parts List
- Motors
  - Most likely 28BYJ-48 stepper motors because they are light and super cheap
- Motor controllers
  - Typically 28BYJ-48 motors come with a ULN2003 controller, so we'll probably use those
- Random wires for connecting motor and controllers
- Arduino
  - Caution: the ULN2003 controllers take 
- Battery
  - Probably a 7.4V rechargeable battery meant for an RC car or plane
- Bluetooth Arduino dongle HC-05 (<$10 on amazon)
  - Lets us send text wirelessly from python (or whatever) on a laptop to the Arduino
- Acrylic for laser cutter 
  - Robot body
  - Wheel of colors
- Screws for attaching motors?
- Thumb screws for pen holders
- Caster wheels
- Cord (fishing line? Thread?)
- Linear slide / rack & pinion / lead screw for pushing off of wall
  - We will ask for hep on this one
